## Topic
#### Our broad focus is on Veterans. Ron and phrits both have deep roots in the military. Ron's grandfather, father and uncle are veterans. Ron attended military school and worked as a chaplain for a homeless shelter. Growing up as an army brat, phrits moved around quite a bit with his family and dedicated years of service to the military as well. Stacey's father is a veteran and she has provided in person and telephonic nursing services to many veterans over the years. Initially, we talked about veterans and access to healthcare but after looking at the data, we have changed course and will be analyzing historical data to predict what locations are likely to have a higher enlistment percentage over the next 5 years.
