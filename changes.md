# README ideas for Final_Project

## Minor formatting corrections/suggestions. Cosmetic only.

Markdown (.md) language itselfe is pretty new to me, so some of this is stuff I'm still figuring out. (Lots of commits along the way. I said it was a silly metric.) It's not as sophisticated as HTML, which is kind of the point. And it's really temperamental about vertical whitespace. The database notes look really terrible in the editor with all of that, but it displays the way it's supposed to.

## Topic
#### Our broad focus is on Veterans. Ron and phrits both have deep roots in the military. Ron's grandfather, father and uncle are veterans. Ron attended military school and worked as a chaplain for a homeless shelter. Growing up as an army brat, phrits moved around quite a bit with his family and dedicated years of service to the military as well. Stacey's father is a veteran and she has provided in person and telephonic nursing services to many veterans over the years. Initially, we talked about veterans and access to healthcare but after looking at the data, we have changed course and will be analyzing historical data to predict what locations are likely to have a higher enlistment percentage over the next 5 years.
