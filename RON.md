## Topic
#### Our broad focus is on Veterans. Ron and Fritz both have deep roots in the military. Ron's grandfather, father and uncle are veterans. Ron attended military school and worked as a chaplain for a homeless shelter. Fritz is a third-generation veteran who served four years in the United States Air Force. He is interested in recruitment demographics, active duty family life, and veterans issues. Stacey's father is a veteran and she has provided in person and telephonic nursing services to many veterans over the years. Initially, we talked about veterans and access to healthcare but after looking at the data, we have changed course and will be analyzing historical data to predict what locations are likely to have a higher enlistment percentage over the next 5 years.

## Machine Learning Model
#### What type of model and why? We plan to start with multiple linear regression and compare the results with ridge and lasso regression since we are looking for predictive trends not classifications. 
#### How are you training your model?
#### What is your model's accuracy?
#### How does this model work?
